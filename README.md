# Overview
Hedgehog Monitor is a set of Python scripts to handle the temperature, light, humidity, 
and activity sensors running on a Raspberry Pi.  It's designed to keep track
 of the habitat for my son's pet hedgehog.

# Features
- Temperature (via DHT22)
- Humidity (that same DHT22)
- Light levels (lux readings via TSL2561)
- Exercise wheel counter (using a Hall Effect Sensor)
- LCD Display:
    - Time/Date
    - Temp, Humidity, Light levels
    - Total distance and revolutions for the excercise wheel
 
*It's currently a work in progress - much needs to be done*

## To Do
- Add support to save data external web (InitialState??)
